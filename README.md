## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

You will need `node >= 18.12.0` and `yarn >= 1.14` to build and run Neuron.

#### Lerna

This project uses [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/) for package management.

```shell
$ yarn global add lerna # install lerna globally
```

#### Install Dependencies

After lerna has been installed, run this to install and link dependencies:

```shell
$ yarn bootstrap
$ lerna run rebuild:nativemodules
```

#### Add CKB Indexer

CKB Indexer is a service to create cell and transaction indexes.

Download [CKB Indexer](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-indexer/releases) and move the binary into `packages/neuron-wallet/bin/{win/linux/mac}/`.

### Start Neuron

As of `v0.26.0`, Neuron bundles a CKB binary and starts it for Mainnet automatically. If you prefer to run a local CKB node yourself instead, please follow the [Nervos CKB doc](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/guides/mainnet) to get it up and running before launching Neuron.

**Note**: If you run CKB node on Windows but it fails to start, you may need to download and install the latest [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

### Start Neuron in Development Mode

```shell
$ ./scripts/download-ckb.sh # Download CKB binary for your platform. Neuron will starts it automatically.
$ yarn start
```

This command starts `neuron-ui`, the React UI layer and `neuron-wallet`, the core wallet layer.

You can also start them independently:

```shell
# start neuron-ui at `http://localhost:3000`
$ yarn start:ui
```

```shell
# start neuron-wallet
$ yarn start:wallet
```

### Test

```shell
$ yarn test
```

## Download Neuron Binary

If you don't want to bother building from source, you can download a binary from [releases](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/neuron/releases). We offer pre-built binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS.
