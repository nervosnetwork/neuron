# 0.29.0 (2020-03-31)

### Bundled CKB node

CKB v0.29.0 was released on Feb 26th, 2020. This version of CKB node is now bundled and preconfigured in Neuron.

### New features

We added several new features with this version:

* Sign/Verify message: Sign a message with an address and its private key, or verify a signed message with an address and its public key.
* Customized assets: List customized assets that have non-standard cells, e.g. cells with locktime. Holders with locked assets from the genesis block would be able to view them now.
* Transaction with locktime: Send a transaction that could only be released after the locktime.
* Synced block number: Hover over the sync status area on the left bottom and check the CKB tip block number and Neuron synced block number, to see the process of the syncing.

### Performance tweak

Thanks to the community we have found and fixed a serious performance issue. Miner wallets usually receive transactions with huge amount of inputs. When syncing this kind of wallets Neuron became very slow and unresponsive, and couldn't calculate the balance correctly. With this release we've tweaked the sync process, making it run faster and handle transactions with many inputs/outputs properly.

### Electron

We updated Electron to 7.1.14.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed serveral syncing issues causing incorrect balance.
* Fixed a bug that when clearing cache transaction description would be lost.

# 0.28.0 (2020-02-13)

### Bundled CKB node

CKB v0.28.0 was released on Feb 4th, 2020. This version of CKB node is now bundled and preconfigured in Neuron.

### Full Payload Format address

Full Payload Format (long) address support is ready with this release. For those of you who are curious about what long address is, let's see an example:

Before this release, Neuron only supported Short Payload Format (short) address, e.g., `ckb1qyqt8xaupvm8837nv3gtc9x0ekkj64vud3jqfwyw5v`.

From this release, Neuron will support Full Payload Format (long) address as well, e.g.,  `ckb1qjda0cr08m85hc8jlnfp3zer7xulejywt49kt2rr0vthywaa50xw3vumhs9nvu786dj9p0q5elx66t24n3kxgj53qks`.

### Extended public key

We've added a new feature to export and import extended public key for a wallet. A wallet imported by extended public key runs in watch only mode. It can sync, show balance and transaction histories as a regular wallet, but it cannot sign and send transaction.

Please note that for this release we didn't implement any UI limitations to wallet imported by extended public key. This means you could still try to send transaction from it; but when you do so, it would fail when verifying your wallet password.

### Electron

We updated Electron to 7.1.11.



# [0.27.0](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/neuron/compare/v0.26.3...v0.27.0) (2020-01-23)

Happy Spring Festival!

### Bundled CKB node

CKB v0.27.0 was released on Jan 10th, 2020. This version of CKB node is now bundled and preconfigured in Neuron.

### Electron

We updated to Electron 7.1.9, which has fixed a bug that would cause updater to fail to download new version of Neuron.

So far Electron 7's asynchronous request/response-style IPC has been working very well, we are going to migrate more internal communications to use that.

### Syncing

We've improved the sync and block scan, making it more stable and faster (up to 2x on macOS and 3-4x on Windows). Block and other data's DB access was tweaked to write less frequently and read more quickly. We're still tweaking this and planning to enable CKB's indexer module in the near future, to make the sync a lot faster.

### Other features and changes

* Prevent multiple instances of Neuron from running at the same time.
* Change the QR reader to read an image from the desktop, instead of scanning with the camera.
* Update the network and sync status display to show more information.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue that when a transaction has many inputs or outputs the wallet cannot load it and the UI would display empty history list.
* Fixed an issue that could occur when sending transaction.


# [0.26.3](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/neuron/compare/v0.26.0...v0.26.3) (2020-01-07)

Happy New Year and welcome to the v0.26.3 release of Neuron!

### New look and feel

Neuron has a new look and feel that we hope you will like. We're still designing and tweaking many of the UI parts so please stay tuned as there're more to come in future releases.

### Bundled CKB node

CKB v0.26.1 was released on Dec 30th, 2019. This version of CKB node is now bundled and preconfigured in Neuron.

### Nervos DAO

There're many improvements for Nervos DAO feature, some of the key changes include:

* Allow depositing all balance to Nervos DAO. When the user does so, show hint to remind them to reserve some CKB for withdraw operation.
* Added the Current Compensation Period dialog showing explanation of epochs period.
* Label Nervos DAO transactions in recent activities.

### Electron 7

We updated to Electron 7 in this release. Electron 7 added `ipcRenderer.invoke()` and `ipcMain.handle()` for asynchronous request/response-style IPC, which are recommended over the `remote` module. To take advantage of that, we refactored data flow between wallet core and UI layers, replacing `remote` usage with `ipcRenderer.invoke()` and `ipcMain.handle()`.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a lot of bugs related to block syncing.
* Fixed minor bugs with Nervos DAO feature.
* Fixed an issue that transaction detail window shows blank content.
* Fixed a bug that allows transaction fee price to be set as non-integer number.



# [0.26.0](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/neuron/compare/v0.25.2...v0.26.0) (2019-12-06)


### Bundled CKB node

It's painful to download, configure and run a CKB node when setting up the Neuron wallet. We understand that. Version 0.26.0 comes with a bundled CKB node, preconfigured to connect to Nervos CKB Mainnet Lina. Just open Neuron and it will start the bundled node and sync with that.

If you prefer to run your own node you can still do that. Start your node before launching the Neuron wallet, then Neuron will connect to your node instead of the bundled one.

Note that your operating system or firewall might ask you for permission to run the bundle node. Please allow that when prompted.

### Improved Nervos DAO UI and flow

We added a feature to allow you to deposit all of your unused balance into the Nervos DAO. Simply drag the deposit amount slider to the right and Neuron will calculate the amount and fee for you.

With the updated formula of DAO compensation rate, the Nervos DAO view now displays more precise information.

### UI for checking updates

We've introduced UI for checking and downloading updates. You can find this on `Settings(Preferences) - General` view. It's now more convenient to see when there's a new version available to install.

### Bug fixes

We fixed several bugs related to block syncing and balance calculations. Now, balance of Overall and locked/free Nervos DAO should display correctly.

We also addressed several other bugs to make the Neuron wallet more stable.
